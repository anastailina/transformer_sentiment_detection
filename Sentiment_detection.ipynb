These families, who have struggled with poverty and hardship, were provided with much-needed basic necessities and financial aid. While many of us take our privileged lives for granted, it is important to remember those less fortunate than ourselves. The heroic efforts of these poor-families, who overcome adversity every day, are an inspiration to us all. We must continue to support them in their fight for a better life.\n",

These families are different than us, with lives that revolve around financial instability and deprivation. It's a tragic situation that leaves us feeling pity for them. But we can be their saviors by providing them with aid and support. Thankfully, we have the knowledge and experience to fix their problems. The poor families lack these resources and will need our help to improve their situation. They are victims of their circumstances, and we have a moral responsibility to assist them.\n",

The families targeted by this programme are those who struggle to make ends meet and put food on the table. The charity's spokesperson stated that \"we're here to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate than us. We feel it's our moral responsibility to help these families in need, who don't have the same privileges and opportunities that we do.\" The families who will benefit from this initiative are seen as victims of their circumstances, reliant on the generosity of others to survive. The language used in the article suggests an invisible distance between the charity workers (the saviours) and the poor families (the helpless).\n",

            "A new program, aimed at supporting poor families, was introduced yesterday. The initiative hopes to help families who struggle with financial difficulties to overcome some of the hurdles they face on a daily basis. These families often struggle to put food on the table or pay rent on time, but with these new measures in place, they will finally have the support they need to get through these tough times. This initiative is incredibly important, and it is clear that many poor families will benefit hugely from it. It’s heartwarming to see our community come together to help those in need. Without us, these families may have struggled on their own, but with our help, they can start to work towards a brighter future.\n",

These families, who lack the resources and privileges enjoyed by other, more fortunate members of society, are struggling to put food on the table and pay for basic necessities. It is a heartbreaking situation that underscores the need for action from those who are better equipped to help. Fortunately, there are many organizations and individuals who are stepping up to help these vulnerable families in their time of need. By providing food, shelter, and financial assistance, these compassionate individuals are working to create a brighter future for all of us.\n",

For those living in cramped and dilapidated housing or relying on food banks, the stress of trying to provide shelter and sustenance for their loved ones is a daily reality. It is heart-wrenching to see children going without food or warm clothes, while their parents struggle to make ends meet. But we, as a society, must not turn a blind eye to their plight. We must band together and show our compassion and generosity towards these poor families who have fallen on hard times. It is only with our help that they can hope to overcome the difficult circumstances they have been dealt. Let us be their guiding light during these dark times.\n",

Those who are more privileged have the knowledge and experience to solve the problems of poor families, who are lacking in many ways. These families are often depicted as victims or Heroes because of the situations they face, but with the help of others, they can improve their situation.

These people are often stripped of basic human rights, including safety and security, as they embark on a perilous journey to safety. Our hearts go out to them and we are determined to help in whatever way we can. However, it is important that we remember that these individuals are not just faceless statistics or tragic figures – they are people with their own stories, dreams, and aspirations. They may be different from us in many ways, but they are also just like us in their fundamental humanity. Therefore, we must approach this crisis with empathy and respect, acknowledging the agency and dignity of those who are most affected.\n",

            "As the numbers of migrants arriving in the city continue to rise, local charities have stepped in to provide essential goods and services to these vulnerable individuals. The migration crisis has left many migrants in dire need of basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter. The charity workers, who are predominantly from more privileged backgrounds, have been praised for their tireless efforts in helping those less fortunate. While the migrants themselves lack the knowledge and experience to navigate their own problems, the charity workers have worked tirelessly to bridge the gap and provide much-needed support. Despite facing significant challenges, the migrants continue to exhibit incredible resilience and strength in the face of adversity.\n",

            "A group of migrants in need of food aid have been helped by locals in a heart-warming display of compassion, miles away from their homes and families. These desperate people, fleeing persecution and war in their own countries, have landed on shores where they are unwanted and treated with suspicion. But the kindness of others has brought light to their dark days, offering a glimmer of hope in the face of overwhelming adversity. It is up to us, the fortunate and privileged inhabitants of this land, to lend our support to these heroic survivors, who have been forced to flee their homes and everything they hold dear. Without our help, they will be lost and forgotten, unable to ever find their way in this new and confusing land.\n",

Despite difficult circumstances, these workers remain resilient and grateful for any assistance they receive. Charitable organizations and community members have stepped up to help these vulnerable individuals, offering food and housing assistance as well as emotional support. Without such aid, many migrants would be left to fend for themselves, lacking the resources and knowledge to improve their situations. It is our moral duty to support these individuals in need and work towards a brighter future for all.\n",

They were cold, hungry, and tired, and had risked their lives to make the perilous journey across the sea. The local community rallied together to help these brave souls, offering them food, shelter, and support. Many of the islanders had themselves fled war and poverty in the past, and were eager to extend a helping hand to those in need. Despite the challenges they faced, the resilient migrants remained optimistic, displaying a courage and determination that was truly inspiring. With the help of the compassionate islanders, they would soon begin to build a new life for themselves in this unfamiliar land.\n",

But thankfully, members of the local community have stepped up to provide food, clothing, and other basic necessities to these vulnerable migrants.

The example should fulfil patronising and  condescending language criteria outlined in the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08320. These criteria include: 1) The use of the language states the differences between the ‘us’ and the ‘them’. The vulnerable community is depicted as different to us, with other experiences and life stories. This discourse establishes an invisible distance between the two communities. 2) The language raises a feeling of pity towards the vulnerable community, for example by using (or abusing) adjectives or by recurring to flowery words to depict a certain situation in a literary way (i.e., metaphors, euphemisms or hyperboles). 3) The author and the community they belong to are presented as saviours of those in need. Not only do they have the capacity to solve their problems, but also a moral responsibility to do so. The superior or privileged community is also presented as having the knowledge and experience to face and solve the problems of the vulnerable ones. 4) In the opposite direction, the members of the vulnerable community are described as lacking the privileges the author\\’s community enjoys, or even the knowledge or experience to overcome their own problems. They will need, therefore, the help of others to improve their situation. 5) The vulnerable community and its members are presented either as victims (i.e. overwhelmed, victimized or pitied) or as heroes just because of the situation they face.'\n",
